ABOUT Theme
=========== 
Attorney is an elegant and responsive theme designed with Attorneys and law firms in mind, though anyone who wants a theme with a corporate look and feel might like it too. It comes with a couple of alternative home page templates, one for static content and one with a latest posts slider. You can also add your own logo, adjust the slider behaviour, base theme colors and control the social media links from the theme customization screen.

This theme is compatible with Wordpress Version 3.4 and above and it supports the new theme customization API (https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API).

All the image graphics and icons bundled with this theme are created by the author and licensed under the GPL.

Supported browsers: Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari and IE9+ (Some css3 styles like shadows and rounder corners are not supported by IE8 and below).
